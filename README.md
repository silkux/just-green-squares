# The Eternal Pokedex and To-Do List

In the vast digital landscape, countless repositories pay homage to the mighty **Pokédex** and the noble **To-Do List**—projects replicated endlessly across portfolios with an air of reverence. But here, in this humble corner of GitHub, we embrace the most fleeting and irrelevant of updates: time itself

Every day, without fail, this README will shift by a mere minute—forward or backward—just as countless Pokédex and task managers march onward in infinite redundancy. This small, almost imperceptible change, is not here to impress, nor to add value. It is here to make a statement.

A statement that, much like another Pokédex or yet another To-Do List, this commit, too, means nothing.

Why? Not for productivity, nor creativity. Simply to remind you:

**Commits are abundant, but meaning is scarce. Don't overestimate the significance of either.**
